Entity-Component System and Examples (Unity3D, C#)
==================================================

## Summary
This is a simple implementation of an Entity-Component System, as well as some examples of
how to apply it to game architecture. It uses Unity 3D and Mono C# as a development/runtime
platform. The component system uses an event manager for message passing between systems and
systems may use a generic implementation of a state machine with custom states for game logic.
The project is ment to help me illustrate the inner workings of Entity-Component Systems to
aspiring game developers and to show them some good and bad decisions. As such, the included
example, by design, is not a perfect use case of the architecture. For more information about
